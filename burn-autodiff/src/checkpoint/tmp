TODOs

- PROBLEM: retro_forwards are not well drained
- PROBLEM: fails powf??? weird
- PROBLEM: div (compute bound, LAZY) and mul (memory bound, LAZY) don't work when not all leaves require grad

  - If removed there's no lazy operations, no checkpoints... normal it passes
  - Node 1 is NOT in backward states nor n_required_map. They concord well.
  - Therefore the problem happens when executing a checkpoint.
  - Once not fail powf:
    - Idea: If a parent is not tracked then force compute bound, because otherwise it will need to re-add all the untracked subgraph which sucks hard

- clean left out comments and prints

- reactivate all operations
